## Project Overview

Missed medical appointments can significantly impact healthcare efficiency and revenue, especially in ambulatory care settings. This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast which patients are likely to miss their scheduled appointments. By identifying high-risk cases in advance, healthcare providers can proactively reduce no-show rates through reminder systems or overbooking strategies.

This project uses patient-level and provider-level datasets to build a classification model. The pipeline includes ETL processes, data preprocessing, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and visualization.
